# Make the image that was TESTED the one that ships, instead of building it
# again. MMagTech, 2026-09-25: the point of `testing` is that a feature is
# built once, tried on his console, and when it is good, that goes to main.
#
# On a push to main: if main's files are exactly the files of the commit the
# current `testing` image was built from, that image is tagged `latest`
# (and latest-<sha>, and the date tags) with no build. Same digest, so the
# same bytes, the same version number and the same signature. If they are
# not the same files (merged without testing, or main moved on since), this
# says so and the workflow builds, as it always did.
#
# "The same files" is the git TREE, not the commit: a merge commit has a new
# hash but, from a branch that was up to date with main, the same tree.
#
# DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT COUNT, EXCEPT docs/LICENCES.md (#156). Every `.md`
# file and everything under docs/ is ignored, the same files build.yml's
# trigger ignores, because none of them is in the image; so a handover or a
# roadmap line written after the testing push no longer costs a rebuild.
# docs/LICENCES.md IS in the image (the Containerfile copies it to
# /licences/), so a change to it still builds. Keep this rule and build.yml's
# `paths` list the same.
#
# Writes promoted=true|false to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
#
# Usage: ci/promote-tested.sh <registry/image>     needs REGISTRY_USER and
#                                                   REGISTRY_TOKEN to push tags
