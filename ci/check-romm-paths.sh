# Does a pull request spell a RomM path outside the RomM client? (#398, step 4)
#
#   ci/check-romm-paths.sh <base> <head>   the lines added from base to head
#   ci/check-romm-paths.sh                 every line of the tree, by hand
#
# Prints each line that spells one, as file:line, and exits 1 if there is any;
# 0 when there is none. .github/workflows/checks.yml runs the first form on
# every pull request; on GitHub each line is also marked on the pull request.
# REPORT ONLY UNTIL A DATE: while today (UTC) is not past REPORT_ONLY_UNTIL
# (YYYY-MM-DD, set by checks.yml), the lines are warnings and it exits 0.
#
# WHY. "The RomM client is the only code that talks to RomM"
# (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). A path spelled anywhere else is a second copy of
# RomM's API that the client cannot see: when RomM changes it, or the client
# learns to ask differently, that copy goes on asking the old way. The ones
# already there are a known gap (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "RomM paths spelled
# outside the client"); this stops the list growing.
#
# A RomM PATH is `/api/`, `/assets/`, `/resources/roms/` or `/cover/` in code.
# The last two are how image.cpp and covercache.cpp take a cover's address
# apart, which `/api/` and `/assets/romm` alone would miss (the audit's
# ROMM-18). Comments are not code: a line that starts with `//`, `/*`, `*` or
# `#`, and whatever follows ` //` or ` #`, is left out, so a comment may name
# the call it explains.
#
# NOT CHECKED: `.md` files and docs/ (prose), tools/ (run by hand, never on a
# console), and EXEMPT below. KNOWN is every path spelled outside the client
# today, by file and by the text that spells it, so a pull request that edits
# or moves one of those lines is not failed for it, and the run over the whole
# tree is quiet. Moving one into the client takes its entry out of KNOWN.
# A known text is taken out of the line before the line is checked, so the
# same line spelling a second, new path still fails.
