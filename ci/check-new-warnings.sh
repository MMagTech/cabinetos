# No new compiler warnings in the files a pull request touches.
#
# CLAUDE.md's rule 6 asks every change for "no new warnings in the files you
# touched"; this is that rule, held by CI (#398, step 4). The tree already
# carries warnings, so -Werror would fail every change for old ones. Instead
# the warnings in the touched files are compared with the same files built
# at the pull request's base, and one that is not at the base is new.
#
# THE BASE IS COMPILED ONLY WHERE IT CAN MATTER. A warning in a .cpp comes
# from compiling that .cpp; one in a header from compiling any .cpp that
# includes it. So at the base this compiles the touched .cpp files, and
# every file that includes a touched header, read from the .d files the
# head's build just wrote (-MMD). Those are the base's own includes too,
# unless an include line changed, and a file whose include line changed is
# itself touched, so the .cpp at the top of that chain is compiled anyway.
# A pull request that touches only a .cpp compiles that one file again; one
# that touches app.h compiles the 53 files that include it.
# The Wii bridge is three files and is built whole, at the base and again
# here at the head, when any of it is touched.
#
# A WARNING IS COMPARED BY ITS TEXT, across all the touched files, not by
# its line or its file: code moved within a file, or from one touched file
# to another (a split, a rename), brings its warning along and nothing new.
# Two of the same warning where the base had one is one new. What that lets
# through is the same warning fixed in one touched file and written in
# another, which leaves the count where it was.
#
# VENDORED FILES ARE NOT CHECKED: rcheevos (frontend/third_party/) and the
# libretro API (frontend/src/libretro.h), check-long-files.sh's VENDORED.
# They are kept as they come, so a warning a new version brings is not one
# a pull request can fix; the Warnings step still lists it.
#
# REPORT ONLY UNTIL A DATE: while today (UTC) is not past REPORT_ONLY_UNTIL
# (YYYY-MM-DD, set by build-frontend.yml), a new warning is the same report
# and a warning annotation, and it exits 0; from the next day it fails, the
# rule checks.yml's checks follow (CONTRIBUTING.md, "What CI checks").
#
# Usage: ci/check-new-warnings.sh <the head's build log>
#
# Run by build-frontend.yml after the Compile step, on pull requests only:
# HEAD is then GitHub's merge of the pull request into its base, so its first
# parent is the base and the checkout needs fetch-depth 2. It needs the
# cabinetos-builder container the job already has.
