#
# REPORT ONLY, NEVER A FAILURE: prints every source file over LIMIT lines,
# longest first, and always exits 0. Given a pull request's base and head
# (.github/workflows/checks.yml runs it on every pull request), it also says
# how much each grew in the pull request, and on GitHub a file it grew is a
# warning on the pull request and the list is the run's summary.
#
# WHY. main.cpp reached 20,018 lines one small addition at a time before #398
# split it into files named for their jobs. A long file is not wrong by
# itself, but new code that is a job of its own belongs in a file of its own
# (CLAUDE.md, rule 2), and a file growing past this size is the sign to look.
#
# A SOURCE FILE is a tracked file under FOLDERS whose name ends .c, .cc, .cpp,
# .h, .hpp, .sh or .py, or that starts with `#!` (the scripts in
# system_files/ have no ending). Data is not source: the shaders and
# controller lists in frontend/data/, and cores/options/, end otherwise.
# VENDORED files are another project's code, kept as it is; they are left out.
