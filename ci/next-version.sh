# The version of the image about to be built: the UTC date, 2026.09.28, and
# 2026.09.28.2, .3 for further images the same day. MMagTech, 2026-09-25;
# docs/SETTINGS.md, System.
#
# NUMBERED BY THE REGISTRY, not by a counter kept anywhere: every published
# image is also tagged with its version, so the tags already there say which
# numbers today has used. A docs-only commit builds nothing and so uses no
# number up. `latest` and `testing` share the one sequence, so a version names
# exactly one image whichever channel it went out on.
#
# Usage: ci/next-version.sh [--strict] <registry/image>
#   --strict  fail if the registry cannot be read, rather than guess. Used for
#             every build that publishes; a pull request build, which
#             publishes nothing, guesses.
