#
# THE PINS ARE THE INSTALL SCRIPTS' OWN, read out of them here, so there is no
# second copy to drift: each script names its file by a `readonly *_URL=` and
# a `readonly *_SHA256=` line. Moving a pin changes the cache key, and the new

#   ci/fetch-pinned.sh fetch <cache> <out>    each file into <cache>/<sha256>
#                                             (from the cache, or downloaded
#                                             and checked), anything else in
#                                             <cache> dropped, and a copy at
#                                             <out>/<sha256> for the image
#
# The install scripts take <out> as /ctx/payload/downloads (lib.sh,
# fetch_pinned) and check the sha256 again themselves, cached or not. Without
# it (an A9 dry run) they download as before.
