# Did the emulators take what the console told them? Run from the Mac, against
# the A9, after a version bump of anything CI cannot load.
#
# THE A9 HALF OF THE VERSION-BUMP CHECK (#63, MMagTech 2026-10-02). CI lists
# every built-in core's options and fails on a difference (check-options.sh,
# tools/core-options.c), and checks every value the console sets against
# those lists (frontend --check-option-tables). Two kinds of emulator are out
# of its reach:
#
#   1. Dolphin and FBNeo declare their options only with a real game loaded.
#      This lists them with games from the console's own cache and compares
#      with cores/options/.
#   2. PS2 and the separate emulators (Eden, RPCS3, xemu, Xenia, Cemu) take
#      settings files or flags, not libretro options. A renamed key is ignored
#      silently by most of them, and Xenia prints its help and exits on an
#      unknown flag. This reads the LAST launch of each from the console's
#      journal and the emulator's own log or rewritten settings file, and says
#      whether what was written was taken.
#
# So the procedure for a bump is: put the image on the A9, start one game on
# each emulator whose pin moved (from Home, or tools/ui-loop.sh --game N),
# then run this. It changes nothing on the console.
#
#   tools/check-applied.sh            both halves
#   tools/check-applied.sh --lists    only the Dolphin and FBNeo lists
