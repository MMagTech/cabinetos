"""Which controllers every Wii game accepts, from GameTDB, as the console reads it.

WHAT IT IS FOR. A Wii game plays on an ordinary pad here only when it accepts
a Classic Controller or a GameCube pad; every other Wii game needs a real Wii
Remote and is greyed out until one is paired. MMagTech, 2026-09-30;
docs/PROJECT.md open question 35, issues #173 and #200. Dolphin carries no such
list (its Sys/wiitdb-*.txt are titles only), so this is GameTDB's.

WHERE IT COMES FROM. GameTDB (https://www.gametdb.com), community-kept since
2009, "for anyone to use in any Wii-related project"; credited in
docs/LICENCES.md. THE FULL FILE, wiitdb.zip with no LANG: the English-filtered
one leaves out WiiWare, Virtual Console and GameCube entries.

WHAT IT WRITES, frontend/data/wii-controls.txt: one line per ID, the ID and
then one letter per controller GameTDB lists, required or optional alike:

    w Wii Remote   n Nunchuk   c Classic Controller   g GameCube pad
    m MotionPlus   b Balance Board   h wheel   z Zapper

GameCube, mod (CUSTOM) and homebrew entries are left out, and an entry that
lists no controls at all is left out too: the console treats a
missing ID as needing a Wii Remote, which is the same answer.

Usage: tools/wii-controls.py [wiitdb.xml]   (downloads the full file without one)
