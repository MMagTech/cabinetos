# Stands up the overlay experiment on the reference console's own television
# and then asks you to LOOK AT IT.
#
# THE QUESTION. PCSX2 and every other emulator that is not a libretro core makes
# its own graphics device and presents its own picture. CabinetOS copies that
# picture off the GPU and back on so it can draw the pause menu over it — 6.1 ms
# of a 16.7 ms frame at 4x. If gamescope will composite our menu on top of a
# window the emulator owns, none of that copying is needed. This script is how
# that was answered on 2026-09-21. The answer is yes; see docs/PROJECT.md, open
# question 24.
#
# IT TAKES OVER THE TELEVISION for as long as it runs, by pointing the session's
# CABINETOS_APP at a test program instead of the frontend. It puts the machine
# back on every exit path, including failure and Ctrl-C. It does NOT touch
# 20-heavy-systems.conf.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO CAPTURE IN HERE. `gamescopectl screenshot` does not capture
# either overlay plane — not with type 1, and not with type 2 "all_real_layers".
# A capture taken with a working overlay on screen comes back showing only the
# game. Most of a session went into chasing an overlay that was on the
# television the whole time. If you want a record, photograph the screen.
#
# Usage, on the A9 itself:
#   tools/gamescope-overlay-test.sh external   the HUD slot: composites, no input
#   tools/gamescope-overlay-test.sh steam      the Steam slot: composites AND takes the pad
#   tools/gamescope-overlay-test.sh gears      glxgears over vkcube, the zero-code version
