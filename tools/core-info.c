// What revision is this core, and is it a core at all?
//
// `build-core.sh` asserts the *checkout* is at the pinned commit. That proves
// what went in, not what came out — and the two have come apart before. Every
// Makefile-based core in the set compiles its own revision into the string it
// reports through `retro_get_system_info`:
//
//     GIT_VERSION := " $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD || echo unknown)"
//
// which is why the builder container carries git (see frontend/Containerfile).
// Build without git and the core silently forgets which revision it is, which
// is precisely the fact the whole core-parity problem is about.
//
// So this reads the answer back out of the finished artifact and asserts it.
// docs/PROJECT.md, open question 13: "asserts at build time that what it
// produced matches. A mismatch becomes a failed build rather than a save state
// that silently will not load."
//
// No ROM is needed. `retro_get_system_info` is documented as callable before
// `retro_init`, so this runs anywhere the .so loads — including CI, which has
// no game to give it.

// Deliberately a single C file with no dependencies beyond dlfcn and
// libretro.h, for the same reason as state-probe.c: the same source must
// compile on macOS arm64 and Linux x86-64, or a difference in the output tells
// you nothing.
