# Steam's own Big Picture session, for the Steam entry. Issue #223.
#
# Picking the Steam tile hands the screen over to this: gamescope in Steam
# mode with Steam's gamepad UI, exactly as Bazzite's deck images run it, and
# back to the console when Steam closes (cabinetos-session, steam_step). It is
# two small upstream packages, about 46 KB of scripts:
#
#   gamescope-session         the harness: starts gamescope in Steam mode,
#                             waits for it, runs the client, tears down,
#                             honours Steam's reboot and shutdown requests
#   gamescope-session-steam   the Steam half: its environment, the client
#                             command, and `steamos-session-select`, which is
#                             what Steam's "Switch to Desktop" runs
#
# Both are bazzite-deck packages, so they are not in our base; they come from
# terra, whose repository file the base already carries, and float with terra
# at build time rather than with the base pin. CabinetOS changes nothing in them.
#
# WITHOUT WEAK DEPENDENCIES, on purpose: gamescope-session recommends
# "cardwire or switcheroo-control", and cardwire is exactly what strip-steam.sh
# removed so that the session launches Steam directly (audit, #223, question
# 2). The build asserts it stayed gone.
#
# NOT installed: gamescope-session-ogui-steam (OpenGamepadUI on top of Steam),
# steamos-manager, inputplumber, steam-notif-daemon, the deck's bootstrap
# tarball. The entry is Steam and nothing else.

# terra is in the base DISABLED (enabled=0; Bazzite turns it off at the end of
# its own build), so it is enabled for this one install and stays off after.
# Found by the dry run on the A9, 2026-10-03: "No match for argument".
#
# FOUR TRIES, A MINUTE APART. Terra's mirror now and then serves a package
# that does not match its own metadata while it is publishing ("Downloading
# successful, but checksum doesn't match"). It failed the image build that way
# twice by 2026-10-04 and a re-run passed both times, so a build that fails
# for it has nothing wrong with it. Each retry drops the downloaded packages
# and refetches the metadata, so it asks the mirror afresh.
