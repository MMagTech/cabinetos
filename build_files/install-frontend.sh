# Put the console into the image: the frontend, the twenty-two libretro cores,

#
# ===========================================================================
#  THIS IS WHAT MAKES AN INSTALLED MACHINE A CONSOLE RATHER THAN A BLACK
#  SCREEN.
# ===========================================================================
#
# Before this existed the image carried the OS half and nothing else. Merge to
# main, the image rebuilt, bootc pulled it, and packages, system files and the
# session service all travelled — but the frontend and the cores did not,
# because they were never in it. `cabinetos-session` ran `sleep infinity`
# inside gamescope, so a freshly installed machine came up, took tty1, started
# a compositor, and drew nothing at all. Every emulator this console can run
# lived on one development VM and was compiled there by hand.
#
# WHERE EACH PART GOES, AND WHY THERE
#
#   /usr/bin/cabinetos-frontend        A program. Where programs go, and on the
#                                      PATH the session script uses.
#
#   /usr/lib/cabinetos/cores/          Architecture-specific shared objects, so
#                                      /usr/lib and not /usr/share. The
#                                      frontend falls back to this path when
#                                      there is no cores/build beside it — see
#                                      the resolution block in main.cpp — and
#                                      --core-dir still overrides both.
#
#   /usr/share/cabinetos/system/       PPSSPP's fonts, VFPU tables and per-game
#                                      compatibility list. DECIDED in
#                                      docs/PROJECT.md open question 18 and
#                                      unbuilt until now: storage::ensureTree
#                                      already symlinks whatever it finds here
#                                      into the console's system directory at
#                                      startup, leaving alone any name that is
#                                      already a real file — which is what
#                                      keeps a development machine working,
#                                      since there the same files sit in bios/
#                                      where the core build left them.
#
#                                      `/system` AND NOT /usr/share/cabinetos
#                                      ITSELF. That directory also holds a
#                                      DEVELOPMENT-IMAGE marker and two package
#                                      inventories, and an earlier version of
#                                      the link step put all three where a core
#                                      goes looking for its fonts.
#
# All three are under /usr, which on a bootc machine is replaced wholesale by
# every update. That is the entire point of doing this: it is what makes the
# frontend and the cores travel with the image the way the session service
# already does. Nothing here may go in /var — see
# system_files/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/cabinetos.conf for what that trap looks like.

# THREE CALLS, ONE PER LAYER, 2026-09-23. The Containerfile runs this once
# for each of `cores`, `system` and `frontend`, in that order, so each lands in
# its own image layer and a console updating after a frontend change downloads
# the frontend and nothing else. See the Containerfile and open question 27.
#
# The checks that need all three present, the library sweep and the final
# list, run in the last call, `frontend`.
