#
# Only CabinetOS images signed with our key may be installed as updates (#135).
#
# WHAT SIGNS: every image build signs the image by its digest with the key in
# the SIGNING_SECRET repository secret (build.yml, "Sign image"). A promotion
# moves a tag to an already-signed digest, so promoted images stay signed.
#
# WHAT CHECKS: this. The image carries the public half
# (/etc/pki/containers/cabinetos.pub, from system_files/), the place
# signatures are kept (registries.d/cabinetos.yaml), and a rule in
# /etc/containers/policy.json that an image from ghcr.io/mmagtech/cabinetos
# must carry a signature made with that key. Bazzite's own rule for
# ghcr.io/ublue-os is the same shape, and is left as it is.
#
# THE RULE ONLY BITES ON A CONSOLE SET TO CHECK: one installed by the
# installer (disk_config/iso.toml switches with --enforce-container-sigpolicy),
# or switched once by hand. A console still on "ostree-unverified-registry"
# keeps updating unchecked. MMagTech is the only user (2026-10-09): his A9 is
# switched once by hand, so there is no automatic migration here.
#
# The key itself is MMagTech's: the secret half is in GitHub and his password
# manager, never in this repository (.gitignore lists cosign.key).
