# Does this build lever reach the save state?
#
# THE QUESTION. CabinetOS shares Cabinet's `emulator` tag on RomM, which is what
# stops a launch screen offering someone a state that cannot load. Sharing it is
# only safe where the two builds are provably the same emulator — same pinned
# commit AND the same build arguments. Several cores turn a recompiler ON for
# Linux x86-64 that Cabinet has OFF, so on those the arguments are not the same,
# and the tag has to be either justified or given up.
#
# THE METHOD. Build the core twice, changing exactly one variable, and compare
# the object files. Objects that differ tell you which source files the lever
# actually reaches, and the answer is usually a handful out of hundreds — at
# which point you read those files rather than the whole core.
#
# This is stronger than the cross-load test it replaces, and far cheaper. Loading
# one game's state written by the other build proves that one game's state
# survives. Finding that nothing under the emulation core differs proves the two
# builds are the same machine code for every game in the library. It was how
# genesis_plus_gx's HAVE_CDROM question was settled (three objects differed, all
# of them CD-ROM plumbing, nothing under core/) and how pcsx_rearmed's DYNAREC
# question was opened (one object differed, and it was the one holding SaveState).
#
# IT IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. A differing object is a place to look, not a
# verdict: pcsx_rearmed's differing object was misc.o, where SaveState lives, and
# reading it showed the state format tolerates either backend deliberately. So
# this points at the files worth reading. It does not read them for you.
#
# Usage:
#   cores/backend-diff.sh <core> <VAR=value-A> <VAR=value-B>
#
# Example:
#   cores/backend-diff.sh picodrive CABINETOS_PICODRIVE_SH2DRC=0 \
#                                   CABINETOS_PICODRIVE_SH2DRC=1
