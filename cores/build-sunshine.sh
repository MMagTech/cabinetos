# Builds Sunshine, Remote Play's streaming host, as a Fedora 44 package: the
# pinned release, with our change for #304 on it, by LizardByte's own recipe.
#
# WHY WE BUILD IT AT ALL (MMagTech, 2026-10-09, #304). Until then the image
# installed LizardByte's own package, never patched. Sunshine copies one
# display plane to the phone, picks it only at certain moments, and when that
# plane goes empty it waits on it for ever: the phone stays black, with sound,
# until it leaves and joins again (LizardByte/Sunshine#5839). Every change of
# planes we did not foresee did that to a stream: a game in Steam, the way
# back from Steam, Steam switching composing off at its own start. Our change
# (cores/sunshine-patches/) makes it pick again once its plane has been empty
# for a quarter of a second, and is offered upstream. Take it out, and go
# back to LizardByte's package, when a release has it.
#
# HOW: EXACTLY AS LIZARDBYTE BUILDS ITS FEDORA PACKAGE (LizardByte/copr-ci,
# copr-ci.sh): the tag with every submodule, the spec's three values filled
# in, the whole tree as tarball.tar.gz, rpmbuild with its own spec. Its build
# dependencies come from that spec (`dnf builddep`), so they follow the pin.
# What we change besides our patch is only where the spec fetches tools from
# the internet unpinned (below).
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS: the source is at the tag's commit; each patch applies, and
# is not already in Sunshine (then this says to drop it); the spec still has
# the lines we fill in or pin; Sunshine's own tests pass (the spec's %check).
# WHAT IT CANNOT: that a stream shows a picture. That is seen on the A9.
#
# Usage: cores/build-sunshine.sh
# Output: cores/build/sunshine/{Sunshine-<version>-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm, VERSION}

# LizardByte's release of 2026-09-14, the one the image shipped from
# LizardByte's package before (#286). To move it: the tag and its commit here,
# build, check each patch still applies (or is upstream now), and go through
# build_files/install-sunshine.sh's list on the A9.

# The spec installs nvm from its master branch and then whatever Node.js is
# newest that day, for building Sunshine's web page. Pinned here instead, so
# the same pin always builds the same way. Node 24 is the current LTS line;
# vite 8 (Sunshine's web build at this tag) needs 20.19 or later.
