# Builds upstream PCSX2 as a LIBRARY for Linux x86-64, at an exact revision,
# and measures what a CabinetOS host layer would still owe it.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT cores/build-core.sh. That script builds libretro cores: one
# upstream, one `make`, one .so that already implements a frontend contract.
# PCSX2 is not a libretro core and has no retro_run. It is a whole emulator
# that expects a frontend to exist around it, and upstream ships exactly two —
# the Qt desktop app and the headless GS runner. CabinetOS has to be the third.
# Until that third one is written there is no .so to ship, so this script's
# product is a library plus an honest measurement, not a core.
#
# THE QUESTION IT WAS WRITTEN TO ANSWER, AND THE ANSWER:
#
#   Does upstream PCSX2's CMake produce a linkable library on Linux, or must
#   the frontend be carved out the way Cabinet had to on the Mac?
#
#   IT PRODUCES ONE, AND NOTHING HAS TO BE CARVED OUT. `add_library(PCSX2)` is
#   upstream's own target in pcsx2/CMakeLists.txt; the application is a
#   SEPARATE target, pcsx2-qt, behind `if(ENABLE_QT_UI)` in the top-level
#   CMakeLists. Turning that option off is supported upstream and leaves the
#   emulator as a static library. ZERO patches. Compare tools/patch-pcsx2-mac.py
#   in Cabinet, which is 546 lines of them.
#
# Usage:
#   cores/build-pcsx2.sh              build the library and run the probe
#   cores/build-pcsx2.sh --probe-only re-run the probe against an existing build
#
# Run it on a machine with the container image and the disk: the A9, the test
# VM, or a CI runner. It needs about 1.5 GB for the checkout and the build.

# UPSTREAM PCSX2/pcsx2, AND NOT THE isztldav FORK CABINET PINS.
#
# That fork exists to add an ARM64 recompiler for Apple Silicon, where upstream
# stubs one out. This is x86-64, where upstream's recompiler is the original
# rather than a translation of it, and the fork is 291 commits behind master.
# Taking it here would be shipping a staler, Apple-specific PCSX2 on the one
# platform PCSX2 supports natively. docs/PROJECT.md, open question 12b.
#
# AND NOT libretro/pcsx2 EITHER, WHICH DOES NOT EXIST. `git ls-remote` on it
# says "Repository not found". That is what sent PlayStation 2 down this route
# rather than the libretro one; see open question 12b again.

# --- configure and build ---------------------------------------------------
# Every flag here is a decision, so each one says why.
#
#   ENABLE_QT_UI=OFF    the frontend is CabinetOS's. This is the flag that makes
#                       the whole route work: it drops add_subdirectory(pcsx2-qt)
#                       and leaves the PCSX2 library standing on its own.
#   ENABLE_TESTS=OFF    googletest builds a host binary, pointless here.
#   ENABLE_GSRUNNER=OFF not built by default — but it is still CONFIGURED, so
#                       the probe below can build it on demand as a link test.
#   USE_VULKAN=ON       the point. PCSX2 supports Vulkan natively and the A9 has
#                       it, so the Metal wall Cabinet had to climb is not here.
#                       docs/PROJECT.md, open question 20.
#   USE_OPENGL=ON       kept as the fallback for a machine with no Vulkan, which
#                       is the test VM, and which is exactly why the frontend's
#                       own host discovers rather than assumes.
#   X11_API=ON          the console runs on X11 under gamescope. There is no EGL
#                       display in that process at all; see NEXT-SESSION.md.
#   WAYLAND_API=OFF     would pull in extra-cmake-modules and Wayland-Egl for a
#                       windowing path this frontend will never use.
#   USE_BACKTRACE=OFF   libbacktrace-devel is the one dependency Fedora 44 has
#                       no package for. It is a crash-reporter nicety.
#   POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON
#                       upstream's default, and load-bearing here rather than
#                       incidental: open question 12's correction says each
#                       emulator becomes its own .so, and a non-PIC static
#                       library cannot be linked into one at all.

# --- CabinetOS's host layer ------------------------------------------------

    # script's output would have carried an emulator that cannot dlopen and,
    # if it had, one that refuses to start because its resources are absent.
    #
    # So the OUTPUT OF THIS SCRIPT IS NOW THE WHOLE PAYLOAD, which is what CI
    # uploads and what ci/stage-image-payload.sh installs.

    # The libraries the console's image does not have. compile.sh works out

# --- the probe -------------------------------------------------------------
# THREE THINGS ARE ASSERTED, AND EACH ONE FAILED A DIFFERENT WAY WHEN IT WAS
# FIRST RUN BY HAND, WHICH IS WHY ALL THREE ARE HERE RATHER THAN JUST THE FIRST.
#
#   1. The library exists and carries the renderers and recompilers this
#      console needs. A library that built but contained a software renderer
#      and no JIT would be a green build and a useless one.
#   2. It LINKS. A static library resolves nothing — Cabinet's own comment on
#      CabinetPS2Smoke.cpp says so — and the cheapest honest link test is
#      upstream's own non-Qt frontend, pcsx2-gsrunner, which is 1332 lines in
#      one file and already implements the whole Host contract.
#   3. What a host layer still owes it, counted rather than estimated. A shared
#      object will link happily with undefined symbols and then fail at dlopen
#      with the FIRST one only, which tells you nothing about the size of the
#      job. `-z defs` makes the linker refuse instead and name them all.
