# THE CORE'S OPTIONS, AGAINST THE LIST IN THE REPOSITORY (#63, MMagTech
# 2026-10-02). The console tells cores option values by name; an upgrade that
# renames one, drops a value or moves a default leaves those answers going
# nowhere, and nothing says so. Every core is pinned, so it can only happen
# when a commit moves a pin, and this is where that commit finds out: any
# difference from cores/options/<core>.txt fails the build, with the
# difference printed. Check it against what the console sets (catalog.cpp,
# quality.cpp, sysopts.cpp), then refresh the file in the same commit.
#
# A SCRIPT OF ITS OWN, not a function in build-core.sh, because CI keys each
# core's cache on build-core.sh: while the check lived there, editing it
# rebuilt all twenty-two cores (2026-10-02). build-core.sh runs this after
# every build and on every cache hit, so the check still runs every time.
#
# Dolphin and FBNeo declare their options only with a real game loaded, which
# CI does not have; their lists come from the A9 (tools/check-applied.sh).
# FCEUmm and MAME 2003-Plus declare inside retro_load_game before reading the
# file, so a stub is enough.
