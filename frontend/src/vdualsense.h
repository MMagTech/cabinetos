// The console's stand-in DualSense (#669): a virtual controller that carries
// the player's tilt, for an emulator that reads motion only from a pad's own
// sensors. The Switch (Eden) in part one; Cemu and Vita3K are part two.
//
// WHY A DUALSENSE AND NOT THE PLAIN VIRTUAL PAD. The plain pads (vpad.h) are
// uinput devices, and SDL reads a pad's motion from the kernel's "Motion
// Sensors" device only when that device's uniq string is the pad's own (SDL
// 3.2.0 and later, 2.30 and later: SDL_sysjoystick.c, GetSensor); uinput can
// set no uniq, so no motion device can ever be paired to a plain pad. The
// kernel's own PlayStation driver, hid-playstation, can: handed a HID device
// with a DualSense's id it asks it three feature reports (calibration 0x05,
// pairing 0x09, firmware 0x20), then makes a gamepad, a "Motion Sensors"
// device and a touchpad, all carrying the pad's address as uniq, and applies
// the calibration to every input report 0x01 it is sent. So the console makes
// such a HID device through /dev/uhid for each player and sends it report
// 0x01 250 times a second, as a DualSense on a cable does. inputtino (MIT,
// what Sunshine uses for a Moonlight player's pad) is the worked example and
// the source of the report descriptor, a transcription of a DualSense's own.
//
// THE ID IS SONY'S DUALSENSE EDGE, 054C:0DF2, over USB
// (docs/decisions/2026-11-10-stand-in-dualsense-id.md): the kernel's driver
// takes only Sony's ids, this is the one no pad in a living room is likely to
// share, and both SDLs in question treat it as a PS5 pad. The name is the
// console's own, "CabinetOS player N", which is how the console tells its
// stand-ins from real pads (players.cpp); the address is made up,
// ca:b1:4e:70:50:0N.
//
// THE UNITS, END TO END. tilt.h hands over SDL's units and axes, metres per
// second squared and radians per second in the DualSense's own frame, because
// the console's SDL (3.4.18, SDL_hidapi_ps5.c) passes a real DualSense's six
// raw values through its calibration with no axis swapped. The kernel's
// driver (7.2.11, dualsense_parse_report) maps the same six raw values to
// ABS_X, Y, Z and ABS_RX, RY, RZ unswapped, and SDL's Linux joystick code
// (the same in 3.2.30 and 3.4.18) reads them back as accel[0..2] and
// gyro[0..2], dividing by each axis's resolution: 8192 per g and 1024 per
// degree a second, the driver's own constants (DS_ACC_RES_PER_G,
// DS_GYRO_RES_PER_DEG_S). So the raw value this file writes is what Eden's
// SDL reads, scaled, and the calibration report is chosen to make that
// scaling plain: the accelerometer's plus and minus are +8192 and -8192, so
// the driver's bias is 0 and its factor 16384/16384, and a raw count is
// 1/8192 of a g on the node, 4 g at the end of the range; the gyroscope's
// plus and minus are +16384 and -16384 with a speed of 1024 each way, so the
// driver multiplies by 2048*1024/32768 = 64 and a raw count is 1/16 of a
// degree a second, 2047 degrees a second at the end, the range a DualSense
// has. The gyroscope's bias words are ignored by the driver and left 0.
//
// THE HAND-OVER, AND WHY IT IS SAFE. tilt.h reads a seated pad on the frame
// thread only, where SDL's events are pumped; this file's report thread
// never touches players.h or SDL. vpad.cpp's pump(), on the frame thread,
// writes each player's latest tilt, presses and stick positions into that
// player's state here under a small lock, and the report thread copies the
// state under the same lock and sends it. A frame that brings no new sample
// repeats the last one, as a real pad repeats its last reading. Rumble goes
// the other way: the driver's output report 0x02 lands on the report thread,
// which keeps the two motor strengths, and pump() reads them and hands them
// to rumble.h on the frame thread, where every other rumble call is made.
//
// THE CONSOLE'S OWN SDL SEES THESE TOO, as it sees every real pad: its HIDAPI
// PlayStation driver claims the stand-in's hidraw node by id, and its hint
// that ignores the plain pads by id (startup.cpp) cannot tell a Sony id
// apart. players.cpp refuses to seat a pad whose device is named "CabinetOS
// player ..." before it is opened, so the player count never moves and no
// press is passed back. Eden's SDL, with its HID drivers off, finds the
// gamepad through its event node and pairs the motion node to it by uniq.
//
// THE LAYOUT IS SDL'S OWN RULE FOR AN evdev DEVICE: buttons numbered in the
// order of their key codes, axes in the order of theirs, the d-pad as hat 0.
// The driver's gamepad has BTN_SOUTH, EAST, NORTH, WEST, TL, TR, TL2, TR2,
// SELECT, START, MODE, THUMBL, THUMBR, then the Edge's four extra buttons,
// and axes X, Y, Z (L2), RX, RY, RZ (R2), so Cross is button 0 and Create is
// button 8, which is where the two shoulder buttons' own key codes put them.
