// THE LIST OF WHAT BELONGS TO AN ACCOUNT WAS WORKED OUT FROM
// `storage::userDir`'s children AND FROM WHAT THE STARTUP PATH BUILDS,
// before this was written rather than after somebody saw their sister's
// save. It is:
//
//   the token           -> accounts::activate
//   who we are          -> adoptUser, which asks /api/users/me again
//   recents, favourites -> loadLibrary; they are RomM's play history and
//   the hero, the shelf    they are per person, not per console
//   the kept badges     -> refreshKeeps, which reads this person's keeps
//
// **THE CATALOGUE IS PER ACCOUNT TOO, AND I HAD THIS WRONG.** This comment
// used to say the library of games is the same for everybody because there
// is one server per console, and that the refetch was incidental. Measured
// 2026-09-21 on the real server: MMagTech sees 1147 games and vivian sees
// 412. RomM scopes a library to the user, so the catalogue belongs on the
// list above rather than beside it.
//
// The code was already right — `loadLibrary` fetches the lot in one pass,
// so everything was being replaced regardless. It is the REASONING that was
// wrong, which matters because the next person to optimise this would have
// read that comment and skipped the refetch.
//
// TWO THINGS REFUSE THE SWITCH, and both are about a save reaching the
// wrong person rather than about tidiness. **THEY ARE NOT EQUALLY LIVE AND
// THE DIFFERENCE IS WORTH KNOWING** — MMagTech asked how you would even
// switch mid-game, and the answer is that you cannot.
