// PlayStation 2, which is an emulator rather than a libretro core.
//
// WHAT THIS IS AND WHY IT IS NOT IN core.cpp. Twenty-one of this console's
// emulators are libretro cores: the frontend loads a `.so`, calls `retro_run`
// once per frame, and is handed back a picture and some samples. PCSX2 is a
// whole emulator. It runs its own machine on its own thread and does not
// return until the game stops, which is the same shape Cabinet found on the
// Mac — `CabinetPS2::Run` "blocks for the entire life of the game and must be
// given its own thread".
//
// So the frame loop cannot drive it. What it can do is take the finished
// picture and the finished sound, hand it the pad, and stop it — which is
// exactly what this header is, and it is deliberately the same four things
// `Core` already does for everything else. `core.cpp` routes to here when the
// platform is `ps2`; nothing above that layer learns a new concept.
//
// THE EMULATOR ARRIVES AS A `.so` AND IS `dlopen`ED, like every core. That is
// not incidental: PCSX2 is GPLv3 and this repository is MIT, and
// docs/LICENCES.md rests its position on exactly that distinction. See
// frontend/ps2/CabinetPS2Bridge.cpp.
