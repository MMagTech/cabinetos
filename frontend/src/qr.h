// A QR code, as a grid of modules. Nothing here draws anything.
//
// WHY A CONSOLE NEEDS ONE. Pairing with RomM is a device authorisation: the
// server hands back a short code and a URL, and somebody has to approve it in a
// browser they are already signed in to. A television has no browser, so the
// URL has to get to a phone, and the only way to move a URL to a phone across a
// room is to put it on the screen in a shape a camera can read. Cabinet's tvOS
// does exactly this in `PairingView`, and it is the reason the ENTIRE typing
// burden of first run is one hostname — the password is never typed on the
// television at all. See docs/CABINET.md and docs/PROJECT.md, open question 15b.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS AND IS NOT. `encode()` turns a string into a square of
// black and white modules. It has no idea what a pixel is, what colour anything
// should be, or how big it should be drawn. That split is deliberate and it is
// what makes this buildable before the screens are: the matrix is a MEASUREMENT
// — a scanner either reads it or does not — while its size on a television, its
// quiet zone and the panel around it are a picture, and pictures wait.
//
// WHY IT IS WRITTEN OUT RATHER THAN LINKED. A QR encoder is about five hundred
// lines of well-specified arithmetic with a fixed, published answer, and the
// alternative is a dependency in the image and in the build container for one
// screen that runs once in a console's life. The spec is ISO/IEC 18004; the
// tables below are from it and each one says which.
//
// THE SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY SMALL. Byte mode, versions 1 to 10, and that is
// all. A RomM verification URL is around fifty characters — version 4 at error
// correction M holds 62 bytes and version 10 holds 213 — so ten versions is
// roughly four times the headroom anything here will ever need. Longer input is
// REFUSED and says so, rather than silently producing something unscannable.
//
// ERROR CORRECTION LEVEL M, and it is a real choice. L recovers 7% and M
// recovers 15% for about one version of extra size. The thing being
// photographed is a television, at an angle, by a hand-held phone, under a
// lamp; that is the situation the higher level exists for. Cabinet's tvOS uses
// CoreImage's default, which is also M.
