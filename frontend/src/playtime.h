// Time played (#128): how long a person has played a game, reported to RomM as
// play sessions and shown on the game's launch screen. docs/PROJECT.md, "Time
// played".
//
// WHAT COUNTS. Only time the game is running: the pause menu stops the clock,
// and so does a game left alone. Time after the last press counts only while
// it is under twenty minutes, which is when the screen dims in a game
// (idle::kGameDimAfter); a game left running all afternoon counts up to the
// last press. A session under a minute is not recorded at all.
//
// WHERE IT LIVES. Per person, in `users/<id> - <name>/playtime.json`: the
// session in progress (written every minute, so a power cut loses at most
// one), the sessions not yet on RomM, and the last total RomM gave for each
// game (so the number is right with no server).
//
// WHOSE TIME RomM RETURNS. A console's token is tied to a RomM device, and
// RomM answers a session list with that device's sessions only. Every
// CabinetOS console pairs under the same device identifier, so for one person
// that is all their play on any CabinetOS console, surviving a reinstall; RomM's
// web player and the Apple TV are not in it. rommapp/romm#4837 asks for the
// whole total.
