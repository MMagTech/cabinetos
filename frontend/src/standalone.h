// Emulators that are whole applications, played as games.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Switch (Eden), PS3 (RPCS3), Xbox (xemu), Xbox 360 (Xenia
// Edge) and Wii U (Cemu) are not libretro cores and cannot be loaded into this
// process the way the other systems are (PS2 included). Eden and xemu come
// from Flathub, pinned in flatpaks.list; RPCS3 is the RPCS3 team's own build,
// in the image (build_files/install-rpcs3.sh), because its Flatpak shows a
// warning box on every start; Xenia Edge is its developer's own build, in the
// image too (build_files/install-xenia.sh), because it is not on Flathub.
// Each one opens its own window and draws its own picture.
// So the console starts the emulator as a separate program, hands it the
// television, and takes the screen back when it ends. docs/PROJECT.md, open
// questions 21, 24 and 32; issue #169.
//
// ONE MECHANISM, ONE ROW PER EMULATOR. Everything here is the same for all of
// them; what differs (where it comes from, the program's name, where its keys
// and settings go) is one row in the table in standalone.cpp and one `prepare`
// case. PS3 is a row, not a second copy of this file; what it needs that
// Switch did not (games that are installed, a close through the window) is a
// field on the row, so the next emulator that needs it gets it the same way.
//
// WHERE ITS STATE LIVES. Each emulator gets `emulators/<core>/` under the
// storage root and runs with that as its working directory. Eden treats a
// `user` folder in its working directory as its whole home (keys, system
// memory, saves, settings, shader cache), so nothing lands in the Flatpak's
// hidden default under ~/.var/app, and no source patch is needed. Batocera
// patched Citron's source to move its keys; this does not have to.
//
// MEASURED ON THE A9, 2026-09-28, before any of this was written: Eden 0.2.1
// from Flathub played Retro City Rampage DX with RomM's v19 keys and no
// firmware; gamescope gave it the screen on its own; SIGTERM to Eden closed
// it cleanly in 0.8 s with `confirmStop=2`.
