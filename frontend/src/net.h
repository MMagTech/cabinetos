// The network, as far as a console needs to care about one.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: first run cannot be completed without a network, and
// that is not a UI decision — docs/PROJECT.md, open question 15b. The entirety
// of this OS is a client of a RomM server, so a machine that cannot reach one
// has nothing to show. There is no "continue without a network", which means
// the network step is a GATE and this file is what the gate asks.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a network settings page and must not grow into one.
// A console needs four answers — am I online, what is on the air, join this
// one, forget that one — and every field below exists because one of those four
// needs it. No proxies, no static addressing, no VPNs, no 802.1X. Enterprise
// networks are REPORTED and REFUSED rather than half-supported, which is open
// question 17's decision and the honest treatment of a form nobody can fill in
// from a sofa.
//
// --- Why nmcli, and not libnm or D-Bus -------------------------------------
//
// This shells out to `nmcli`. That looks like the lazy answer and it is the
// considered one.
//
//   * libnm is GLib-shaped: it wants a GMainLoop, and this program already has
//     a frame loop that owns the process. Bolting a second event loop on for
//     four questions is a threading model, not a feature.
//   * Raw D-Bus (sd-bus) avoids the loop but not the work: adding a Wi-Fi
//     connection means hand-building a nested `a{sa{sv}}` of NetworkManager's
//     settings schema. That is the part most likely to be subtly wrong and the
//     part with no way to check it by hand.
//   * nmcli does exactly that construction, is already in the image, is the
//     same command a person would type, and therefore any fault here can be
//     reproduced at a shell in one line. On a project whose rule is "measure
//     rather than reason", that last property is worth more than elegance.
//
// The price is parsing, and it is paid in one place: `--terse` output is
// colon-separated with `\` escapes, and an SSID may legally contain a colon.
// Everything that reads nmcli goes through `unescapeField` for that reason.
//
// --- NOTHING HERE GOES THROUGH A SHELL -------------------------------------
//
// An SSID is a string an attacker chooses. Anyone within radio range can name a
// network `"; rm -rf ~"` and this console will list it. So every command is run
// with fork/execvp and an argv array, never popen and never a constructed
// command line. That is not defensiveness about a hypothetical — a scan puts
// unvetted bytes from strangers into this process, every time it runs.
//
// The one exposure kept rather than solved: a passphrase passed to `nmcli` is
// visible in that process's argv while it runs. On this machine that is not an
// escalation — the only readers are the same user and root, and NetworkManager
// stores the passphrase where root can read it anyway — but it is written down
// here rather than left to be discovered.
//
// --- IT BLOCKS, AND CALLERS MUST TREAT IT THAT WAY -------------------------
//
// A scan takes seconds and joining a network takes tens of them. Every call
// here is synchronous, exactly as romm::Client is, and for the same stated
// reason: this does not own a thread, so the cost is the caller's to see. Call
// it from a worker. A frame loop that calls `scan()` has stopped drawing.
