// The in-game shortcuts: one button, held with a second, while a game plays.
// docs/PROJECT.md, "The in-game shortcuts, and three states per game" and
// "The shortcut button is set by pressing it" (issues #76 to #80).
//
// OFF BY DEFAULT, one switch in Settings. With it on, a tap of the shortcut
// button opens the pause menu and holding it with a second button runs a
// shortcut. The combinations are fixed (main.cpp, where the pads are read).
//
// THE BUTTON IS SET BY PRESSING IT, and it is read RAW: the joystick's own
// button number, not the gamepad mapping. That is the point of it. On the A9,
// 2026-09-27, the community list mapped an 8BitDo Lite 2's heart to the wrong
// button, so the app never saw Home from that pad; a raw button works whether
// or not the list is right. A raw number means different things on different
// models, so it is remembered per KIND of pad (SDL's GUID), not per pad: set
// once for a Lite 2, every Lite 2 uses it.
//
// Unset, a pad uses its mapped Home, which is right for most pads.
