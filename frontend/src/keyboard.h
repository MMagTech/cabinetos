// The on-screen keyboard.
//
// The baseline for all text entry, per the input model in docs/PROJECT.md: the
// controller is the only device the design may assume exists, so every field
// has to be fillable with a d-pad and two buttons. A physical keyboard types
// into the same field at the same time, and neither implementation may be the
// only one.
//
// There is nothing to copy here. Cabinet never wrote one — tvOS supplied it —
// so this is designed from the input model rather than ported.
//
// Three decisions worth stating, because they are the ones that make it
// bearable rather than merely possible:
//
// A PASSWORD IS MASKED, BUT THE LAST CHARACTER SHOWS. Reversed 2026-09-24 by
// MMagTech, from "show what was typed, including passwords" (open question
// 17). The objection to masking was that a typo nobody can see only surfaces
// as a failed join; showing each character for a moment as it is typed, the
// way phones do, answers that, and the "show" key reveals the lot before
// done. Callers ask for it with `conceal`; other fields are shown as typed.
//
// REDUCE TYPING RATHER THAN SPEEDING IT UP. A key that inserts ".com", a
// prefilled scheme, and a remembered previous value each save more than any
// amount of layout tuning.
//
// NO WRAPPING AT THE EDGES. Moving off the right of the keyboard does nothing
// rather than teleporting to the left. Wrapping reads as a glitch when you are
// holding a direction, and the whole point of a ten-foot UI is that focus goes
// where you pointed.

    // keyboard can still be driven by a wired controller."* Both do: this moves

    // presses. There is no pointer-only affordance and no key that can only be
    // reached with a mouse.

    // WHY THE KEYBOARD NEEDS IT AT ALL. A mouse that drives the list behind
    // this panel and then goes dead the moment a password field opens is worse
    // than no mouse: it teaches somebody it works and abandons them at the
    // hardest typing in the whole flow. And people arrive here straight out of
    // a pointer-driven installer — MMagTech's argument, and a better one than
    // the document had.
