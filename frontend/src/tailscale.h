// Tailscale, for Remote Play away from home. docs/SETTINGS.md, Remote Play;
// issue #286.
//
// WHY TAILSCALE, AND ONLY TAILSCALE (MMagTech, 2026-10-08; PROJECT.md
// question 39): it works behind any router with nothing forwarded, which is
// how PlayStation Remote Play feels, and it is already in the image (from
// Bazzite). Somebody with their own way home (WireGuard, a Tailscale subnet
// router of their own) leaves it off and loses nothing.
//
// IT LIVES UNDER STREAMING: tailscaled.service runs only while Streaming is on
// AND Tailscale is on, so it can never be on by itself, and off means it is not
// running at all. Its settings are the image's, set by the unit every time it
// starts (tailscaled.service.d/50-cabinetos.conf): the console's own user may
// drive it (operator), it takes no DNS and no routes from the network, and it
// sends Tailscale no logs. The firewall lets Tailscale reach Sunshine's ports
// and nothing else (cabinetos-tailscale zone).
//
// THIS DRIVES THE `tailscale` COMMAND, the part Tailscale documents and keeps
// stable; the local API under it can change without notice. Every call is a
// short process, so the status is asked on a thread of its own every two
// seconds, and only while somebody is looking at it.

// SIGNING IN: `tailscale up`, which waits until the person approves it in a
// browser. It runs on its own thread; the link appears in last().authUrl, and
// last().state becomes "Running" when they have signed in. `again` signs a
// console that is still signed in in afresh (--force-reauth), which starts
// its 180 days again and keeps its name and address.
//
// `up`, NOT `login`: `login` on a console that is signed in adds a second
// account beside the first (Tailscale's account switching); `up` signs in the
// one it has. And `up` refuses to run unless every setting that is not
// Tailscale's default is named, so it names the image's two (tested on the
// A9, 2026-10-08; the operator is not one it asks for).

// Whether the sign-in command is still running. It ends at once, with no
// link, when the console was signed in already.

// with the reason when it failed.

// for a worker that has just started it. Blocks for a moment.

// Off Tailscale: the console is removed from the user's Tailscale and has to
// sign in again. Blocks for a moment; run on a worker.
