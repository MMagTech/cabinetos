// Which Wii U games play on an ordinary pad.
//
// THE RULE, MMagTech 2026-10-01 (docs/PROJECT.md open question 36), Wii's rule
// carried over: a Wii U game plays on a pad when GameTDB says it takes a Pro
// Controller or a Classic Controller, and each player's pad is a Pro Controller
// to Cemu. A game that takes a Wii Remote and neither of those needs a real
// Remote, greyed until Remotes come (#200). Everything else was made for the
// GamePad, its second screen and its touchscreen, which nothing can provide:
// greyed for good, "Needs a Wii U GamePad". Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is
// one. One rule, no per-game exceptions.
//
// WHO KNOWS WHAT. GameTDB lists a game's controllers under its product code
// (`BWPE01` for Hyrule Warriors on disc, `WKNE` for Shovel Knight from the
// eShop); the console ships its list as /usr/share/cabinetos/wiiu-controls.txt,
// made by tools/wiiu-controls.py. RomM knows the title ID (`1017D800`) but not
// the product code, and GameTDB lists no title IDs. The product code is in the
// game itself, in its `meta/meta.xml` (`WUP-P-BWPE`), so the console reads it
// there: from the END of a `.wua`, where its table of contents is, in a few
// small HTTP ranges, without downloading the game. Measured on Hyrule Warriors
// (7.65 GB, base game, update and DLC): five reads, 434 KB.
//
// A game whose code cannot be read, or whose code GameTDB does not list, needs
// the GamePad. That is the safe side, as it is for Wii: nothing says it takes a
// pad.
