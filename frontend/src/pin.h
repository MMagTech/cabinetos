// The PIN pad: four digits, entered with a controller, in a panel over the screen.
//
// docs/SETTINGS.md, Accounts, and issue #57. The owner of the console (the
// first account from setup) can set one PIN. With one set, Wi-Fi changes, Sign
// out, Change server address, Adding or removing an account and File access
// ask for it, and so does switching into the owner's account. The PIN is a
// deterrent against a sibling with a controller; accounts.h says plainly what
// it is not.
//
// IT IS A LAYER, NOT A SCREEN. It is asked for from the account panel and
// from Settings, so it is not on the stack but drawn over whatever is there,
// the way the account panel is. The app opens it, takes its input first while it is open,
// and decides what an entered PIN means.
//
// IT HOLDS NO OPINION ABOUT THE PIN, the division every screen here follows.
// It collects digits and says when four have been entered. Whether they are
// right is `accounts::checkPin`, called by the app, which answers with
// `reject` or `close`. The one thing it does itself is the second entry when
// a new PIN is chosen, because "type it again" is part of entering it.
//
// FOUR DIGITS, fixed. A starting value: long enough that a guess is not a
// guess, short enough to type with a d-pad.
//
// THE PAD IS A TELEPHONE'S, 1 2 3 across the top, because that is the layout
// everyone already knows from a phone's passcode screen. The bottom row is
// Cancel, 0 and Delete, so every way out is a key focus can land on and not
// only a button somebody has to know about.
