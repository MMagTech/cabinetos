// Each controller's battery, for the row on Home and the low-battery notice
// (issue #293, decided with MMagTech 2026-10-08; docs/PROJECT.md question 40).
//
// ONE RULE FOR EVERY PAD, first answer wins:
//   1. The kernel's battery entry for the pad (/sys/class/power_supply, scope
//      Device, whose device is the pad's HID device). Every Linux driver that
//      knows a pad's battery fills one in: Xbox, Switch-type, PlayStation,
//      Steam and the rest. A percentage or a level word, and charging.
//   2. SDL's own reading, for a pad the kernel has nothing for and one of
//      SDL's own drivers does (some 8BitDo models in their own mode).
//   3. Nothing: the pad shows its label only.
// Measured on the A9: an Xbox One S read 52% from the kernel and nothing from
// SDL in twenty minutes; an 8BitDo in Switch mode read a level and charging
// from the kernel and nothing from SDL. SDL's Linux path for pads the kernel
// drives has no battery code at all (3.4.16).
//
// A stream's pad is label only whatever its entry says: Sunshine's stand-in
// carries a battery entry that stays at 100% (A9, 2026-10-08, with the real
// pad's light amber). Wii Remotes are read by the console itself
// (wiiremote.cpp), because the bridge hides them from the kernel.
//
// EVERY READING BECOMES FOUR SEGMENTS. Exact is not the point: the last
// segment is the warning, and every pad reaches it before it is empty,
// whatever steps it reports in (some step 100/75/50/25/0 and never show 10%).
