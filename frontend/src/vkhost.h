// The Vulkan half of the core host.
//
// WHAT THIS BUYS THE PRODUCT. PlayStation 2 and GameCube — 85 games on the
// reference server, the largest tier this console cannot play. Both were
// measured on the A9 running inside the existing host and both failed for the
// same reason, which is not a bug in either of them:
//
//   * PCSX2's graphics synthesiser refuses an OpenGL ES context outright.
//     "OpenGL is not supported. Only OpenGL 3.2 was found", and then it draws
//     nothing while the emulated machine runs perfectly and makes sound.
//   * Dolphin renders from a thread of its own. It booted Mario Kart, ran
//     fifty seconds of emulated time and produced correct audio while the
//     whole 3840x2160 frame stayed at the letterbox glow, because a GL context
//     belongs to ONE THREAD and the frontend's thread is not the one drawing.
//
// VULKAN IS NOT A WORKAROUND FOR THOSE TWO, IT IS THE ABSENCE OF WHAT CAUSES
// THEM. There is no current context in Vulkan and no thread affinity: a device
// and a queue are objects any thread may use. That is the whole reason a real
// emulator can be hosted through it and cannot be hosted through GLES, and it
// is why this is the right answer rather than the cheap one.
//
// It also serves three things already on the books. Open question 20 asks for
// exactly this and names them: PS3 needs it (RPCS3's good renderer is Vulkan),
// N64 wants it (parallel-RDP is already compiled into the core here and cannot
// be reached), and Dreamcast benefits (Flycast's Vulkan renderer is the faster
// one).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE UI STAYS ON OPENGL ES, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A SHORTCUT.
//
// Every screen this console has was drawn in GLES and looked at on a
// television. Rewriting all of it in Vulkan would put every one of them back
// in the air to gain nothing a person could see. Two facts settle it:
//
//   1. The test VM HAS NO VULKAN DEVICE — measured, `--gpu-probe` says "the
//      only Vulkan device here is a software one". A Vulkan-only frontend
//      could not run on the machine this project is developed on.
//   2. The picture can cross between the two APIs with no copy at all. Vulkan
//      exports the image it drew as a dmabuf and EGL imports the same memory
//      as a texture. Measured present on the A9's radeonsi:
//      VK_KHR_external_memory_fd, VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf,
//      EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.
//
// So the shape is: cores that want Vulkan get a real Vulkan device, and what
// they draw arrives in the same `GLuint` the UI already knows how to put on
// the screen. `Core::texture()` does not change meaning, and neither does the
// player.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE PICTURE'S ROUTE, AND WHY THERE IS A BLIT IN IT.
//
//      core's VkImage  ──vkCmdBlitImage──►  our VkImage  ──dmabuf──►  EGLImage
//                                           (exported)                    │
//                                                                    GL texture
//
// The core owns the image it drew and may recreate it whenever its internal
// resolution changes; libretro is explicit that the frontend may not keep the
// pointer. Ours is allocated once at a fixed maximum and is the thing EGL
// holds, because an EGLImage is bound to one piece of memory for its life —
// re-importing every frame would be a syscall and a driver allocation per
// frame. So the blit is what makes the import stable, and it is also where
// the queue-family ownership transfer libretro requires happens.
//
// THE PICTURE OCCUPIES A CORNER OF THE TARGET, exactly as it does for the
// GLES hardware path, which is why `frameUV` exists there and here.
