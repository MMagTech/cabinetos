// RetroAchievements (#74): softcore only, opt-in, per person.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. MMagTech, 2026-10-06: an incentive for other people to use
// the console. Somebody who never signs in never sees it: no row on a game's
// page, no pop-up, nothing (the Settings row is the one way in). Somebody who
// does gets a pop-up that fades in and out over the game when they earn one,
// never pausing it or taking a button, and a list on the game's page.
//
// SOFTCORE, AND ONLY SOFTCORE (decided 2026-10-05 on #74). Hardcore needs
// RetroAchievements to approve this frontend and keep every release to their
// checklist; none of it is built, hidden or otherwise. States and rewind work
// as they always do.
//
// THE LIBRARY IS rcheevos' rc_client, vendored in third_party/rcheevos, which
// is what RetroArch, Dolphin and PCSX2 use. This file gives it the three
// things it asks a frontend for: the network (libcurl, on a worker), the
// emulated machine's memory (the core's map through rc_libretro, or PCSX2's
// memory through the bridge), and somewhere to say what happened (the pop-up
// queue and the log).
//
// THE GAME IS IDENTIFIED BY RomM's `ra_hash`, which RomM works out when it
// scans: the fingerprint RetroAchievements knows the game by. The console never
// reads the game file for it, so a .chd disc needs no disc reader here.
//
// THREADS. Everything here is called on the frame thread, except what the
// PlayStation 2 frame callback does on PCSX2's CPU thread (rc_client's own
// lock covers that, and it is where PCSX2's own achievements code does it).
// Network answers are handed back to rc_client on the frame thread, in pump().
