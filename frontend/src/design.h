// The design system, as numbers.
//
// Every value here is quoted from docs/PROJECT.md, "The design system". If one
// of them changes there, it changes here, and nowhere else. It lives in a
// header rather than in main.cpp because the screens are separate files now and
// two copies of a focus scale is how a shelf and a grid end up disagreeing
// about what focus looks like.
//
// The numbers that are NOT arbitrary, and that a tidy-up will otherwise undo:
//
//   THE FOCUS SCALE SHRINKS AS THE ELEMENT GROWS — 1.10 for a cover, 1.06 for a
//   pill, 1.03 for a full-width row. A row growing a tenth collides with its
//   neighbours; a pill growing a thirtieth does not read at all.
//
//   RESERVED HEADROOM IS A LAYOUT OBLIGATION. A shelf carries 24pt of vertical
//   padding for no reason except that its cards grow when focused. Every
//   container holding focusable elements has to budget for their focused size.
//
//   180 ms IS THE FOCUS TEMPO and nothing about focus is slower. A controller
//   crosses a shelf faster than that and the animations must not queue up
//   behind the person driving them.

//
// That reasoning came from tvOS, where nothing spans the screens. It stopped

// them: the bar draws at 60 on every screen, so on the Library the bar, the
// switcher and the tiles each began at a different x and the eye had three
// left edges to choose from. MMagTech: *"the library and collection text dont
// seem to match home now either."* The type was never the problem — the
// switcher is Title 3, the same as Home's shelf headings — the margin was.
//
// A PILL IS PULLED BACK BY ITS OWN PADDING so that its LABEL lands on the

// text 14 points inside everything else on the screen, which is the same fault
// one level down. See LibraryScreen::drawGlass and GridScreen::drawGlass.

//
// MMagTech: *"holding down should probably do the same as well."* The honest
// answer is better than the question: holding a direction on the pad did
// NOTHING. SDL sends one button-down per press and there was no repeat anywhere
// in this frontend, so a person holding Down on a 141-game platform moved one
// row and then waited. That is not a missing shortcut, it is a missing
// baseline — every console UI has had this since the d-pad was invented.
//
// It repeats rather than jumping by letter, and the distinction matters: the
// triggers already mean "jump to the next letter" and giving a held direction
// the same meaning after some interval makes the first press feel broken while
// you wait to find out which one you are getting. Same meaning, faster.
//
// THE FIRST REPEAT WAITS LONGER THAN THE REST. Without that pause, a normal
// single press on a pad whose contacts are slow reads as two, and focus
// overshoots by one every time — which is worse than no repeat at all.
// HOW LONG WORK HAS TO LAST BEFORE THE CONSOLE SAYS IT IS WORKING.
//
// A progress panel for something that finishes in eighty milliseconds is not
// information, it is a flash. Pressing Play on a game already on the disk still
// checks the firmware and looks for the file, and that was enough to paint one.

// while the interface is still drawing and still animating, then the blocking

// dark is the console acknowledging a press and should be brisk; coming back is
// the game arriving and is the part worth watching.

//

// scale alone. Cannon Fodder's orange against the dark backdrop was doing more
// to catch the eye than the focused card was.
//
// So everything that is not focused is laid under a scrim and the focused one
// is not. It is the cheapest possible version of the idea — no desaturation, no
// second texture, one black rectangle at 22% — and it does two jobs at once:
// the wall calms down, and focus gains a signal that works from across a room
// where a 4pt rim does not.
//
// IT IS A SCRIM, NOT AN ALPHA. Drawing the art at 0.78 would blend it into the

// THE TOP BAR IS ITS OWN STRIP — 2026-09-21.
//
// It used to be drawn over the hero's top edge, with a black scrim under it to
// keep the destinations legible against artwork. MMagTech: *"the top bar with
// library settings and search should not be on the hero and be its own
// separate thing at the top."* Right, and the capture says why: with the bar
// inside it, the hero stopped reading as a piece of artwork and started
// reading as a header with a picture in it.
//
// It cost the hero 96 points when it was first moved, and then the hero went
// altogether — so the room came back and more with it. Home fits in one screen
// and that is a rule with a name on it: MMagTech, 2026-09-19, "I should not
// have to scroll down to see the favorites."
//
// THE THREE NUMBERS, AND THEY WERE WRONG THE FIRST TIME. 60 / 60 / 16 put the
// bar at the safe inset with a tight gap under it, and MMagTech on the panel:
// *"you also left too much negative space above the top bar and the top
// entries seem to clash with recent row and text below it."* Both halves of
// that are the same mistake — the room was above the bar, where nothing uses
// it, instead of below it, where two rows of left-aligned text at the same
// size were sitting 70 points apart and reading as one crowded block.
//
// So the gap moved from above to below: 44 / 56 / 44.
//
// THE SAFE INSET IS 60 AND THE BAR NOW STARTS AT 44, which is a deliberate
// exception and the only one in the product. Nothing a person must read may
// sit outside the safe area, and the bar's text at 44 puts its ascenders at
// about 52. It was judged on the 65-inch rather than reasoned about; if a set
// with real overscan ever clips it, this is the number that did it, and

// 46. A heading sat almost exactly HALFWAY between the chrome above it and the
// artwork below it, so it belonged to neither — the eye read bar and heading as
// one block of text and the shelf as something unlabelled underneath.
//

//
// THE COVERS GREW FROM 158x210 TO 240x320 — 2026-09-21. They were cut to
// 158x210 to fit two shelves under the hero: design.h recorded "about 430
// points had to come out of a 1080 canvas", and the covers paid 137 of them.
// Removing the hero gave 284 back and this is most of where they went.
//
// NOT the reference implementation's 260x347, which was the first attempt and
// did not survive its own focus scale — see kShelfHeadroom. A 347 cover needs
// 34 points of headroom above and below it, two shelves of that is 136, and
// the canvas does not have 136 spare. 320 does fit, headroom and all.
//
// Budget, and it deliberately does not fill the canvas:
//   44 bar top + 56 bar + 68 gap + 2 x (46 header + 0 + 34 + 320 + 34)
//   = 1036 of 1080, leaving 44 as overscan allowance at the foot.
//
// SIX COVERS FIT A ROW instead of ten, and that is the trade: 240 + 40 of
// spacing is 280 a card across 1800 points of content width. Fewer games in
// reach of the eye, each of them legible from a sofa.
//
// A television eats the edges, and this project has resized Home's artwork

// title's hero banner full-bleed behind everything, with no container at all,
// so moving along the row changes the whole picture.
//
// WHAT IS TAKEN IS THE IDEA, NOT THE LOOK. MMagTech, asked to be clear about
// it: *"these are just lessons i want this to still remain cabinet distinct."*
// So the purple gradient stays exactly as it is and the art goes OVER it at
// part strength — Home is a purple room lit by the game you are pointing at,
// rather than Valve's black screen filled with somebody's key art. The
// difference is visible in one glance and it is the whole point.
//
// Three numbers, and each is a judgement to be made on the television:
//
//   FILL is how much of the art shows through. Past about 0.6 the purple stops
//   being the ground and the screen belongs to the cover.
//   SCRIM is what keeps small white captions readable over a bright cover.
//   TEXELS is the blur, expressed as the width the art is averaged down to
//   rather than as a mip bias — see blurToTexels, and the bug that forced it.
//
// 0.45 / 0.25 / 16 was the first attempt and it was too polite: on the panel it
// read as a faint colour wash rather than as the game lighting the room. These

// console's own scene texture. That works only while the console is the thing
// drawing the game. It is not, for the emulators that are not libretro cores —
// PCSX2 and the heavy systems after it own their own window and gamescope
// composites our menu on top, so there is no game in our texture to blur and
// the panel came out flat on that path and frosted on this one.
//
// MMagTech's call: *"if its just about consistency then we can remove the glass
// from this menu and maybe add a little style to both to make them match."*
// Right, and it deletes work rather than adding it — the alternative was
// grabbing the screen once per pause to blur ourselves, which is a READBACK,
// the exact thing the compositing route exists to remove.
//
// So both paths now run the same code with no branch in it at all. Every OTHER
// glass surface — the Home hero, Library, Grid and Detail — is untouched,
// because those only ever appear while the console is drawing the whole scene.
