// Everything the design system describes is a rounded rectangle with some
// combination of fill, border and shadow — a cover card, a settings row, a
// pill, the pause panel. So that is the one primitive this renderer has, drawn
// with a signed-distance field in the fragment shader rather than with geometry,
// which is what makes a 4pt inset rim and a 26px soft shadow cheap and exact at
// any size.
//
// Coordinates are design points in a 1920x1080 space, origin top-left, matching
// docs/PROJECT.md's "The canvas". The projection handles the rest, so a 4K panel
