// Cover art kept on disk, so a console does not re-download its own artwork
// every time it is switched on.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Nothing about a library survives a boot — the whole of what
// a console remembers is three files in config/ — so every start re-fetches
// every cover it draws. On a LAN that is a few megabytes nobody notices. Open
// question 29 established that RomM is not always on a LAN, and on a hosted
// server it is the same few megabytes over somebody's uplink, every time.
//
// IT IS NOT A SNAPSHOT OF THE LIBRARY, and that distinction is what keeps it
// clear of open question 22. Nothing here records which games exist, what they
// are called or which platform they belong to. It stores image BYTES under the
// server's own path for them, and a path this console was not told about by a
// live server is never read.
//
// --- THE PATH IS THE VERSION ------------------------------------------------
//
// RomM hands out cover paths with the art's own timestamp on them:
//
//   /assets/romm/resources/roms/15/569/cover/small.png?ts=2025-03-11 06:56:03
//
// So changed art is a changed path, which becomes a different file here, and
// the stale one is simply never asked for again. **That is why there is no TTL
// and no revalidation.** MMagTech raised the TTL question — art that sits on
// disk forever after a platform is deleted — and the answer is a sweep against
// the server's own list rather than a clock; see docs/PROJECT.md question 30.
// The sweep is NOT built yet, which is the honest state of this file.
//
// --- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CACHED ----------------------------------------
//
// Only rom cover art. An avatar comes from /api/users/<id>/avatar, which
// carries no version in its path and changes when somebody changes their
// picture, so caching it would show a stale face with no way to notice. Any
// key this does not recognise is passed through uncached rather than guessed
// at.

// --- The tile map -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Which picture a platform's TILE shows, remembered between boots.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A LIBRARY SNAPSHOT, since that rule is open question 22's and
// it matters: this records "platform 15's tile shows this picture". It does
// not record which games exist, what they are called, or which platform they
// are on, and nothing can be browsed from it. It is also only ever READ on a
// boot where the platform list came back — the console exits before reaching
// it otherwise — so it cannot change what an offline console shows.
//
// WITHOUT IT the console spends 1.07 s and about 0.33 MB at every single start
// asking thirty-six times which cover a tile should use, and getting the same
// thirty-six answers it got last time.
//
// VALIDATED, NOT EXPIRED. Each row carries the platform's `updated_at` and
// `rom_count` as the server reported them when the row was written. Both come
// free with the platform list that boot already fetches, so checking costs no
// request. A platform whose either value has moved is re-asked; the rest are
// not. There is no TTL here for the same reason there is none anywhere else in
// this file.

    std::string cover;      // the path to draw

// --- Keeping it from growing forever ----------------------------------------

// Deletes everything belonging to a platform the server no longer lists.
//
// THIS IS THE ANSWER TO "WHAT STOPS DELETED ART SITTING ON DISK FOREVER", and
// it is a sweep rather than a clock: a platform that is gone stops appearing in
// the platform list, so it is orphaned the FIRST time the console sees the
// server without it, not whenever a timer happens to expire.
//
// CALL IT ONLY WITH A LIST THAT CAME BACK. Absence is not deletion when the
// server could not be reached, and a sweep on a failed fetch would wipe the
// cache on exactly the boot that most needs it.

// The reserve check on write is a backstop that keeps the console updatable;
// this is the actual policy.

// on the reference server and roughly 4 GB at twenty thousand games, so this
