// EMPTY IS THE CORRECT STARTING POINT AND IT IS NOT THE OLD BEHAVIOUR. With no
// overrides at all, every option a core declares is still answered — with the
// core's own stated default. That alone fixes the thing that was actually
// broken: an unanswered option is not the default, it is the zero the C global
// was initialised to. See core.h.
//
// This is where a choice goes when CabinetOS wants something OTHER than what a
// core ships with. Cabinet hand-picks a subset per platform rather than dumping
// everything a core reports — see docs/CABINET.md, `NativeCoreOptions.swift` —
// and that list is the obvious thing to bring across, one platform at a time,
// with a reason recorded for each.

// check (optcheck.h) can test every answer on any machine.
