// Cover art for the CabinetOS frontend.
//
// Three things this has to get right, and all three come from the reference
// implementation having got them wrong first.
//
// IT MUST NEVER BLOCK THE FRAME LOOP. A shelf scrolls past dozens of covers and
// each one is a JPEG decode; doing that on the thread that drives the core is
// how a console stutters. Decoding happens on workers, the GL upload happens on
// the frame thread because GL is not thread-safe, and a cover that is not ready
// simply is not drawn yet.
//
// IT MUST HAVE A BUDGET. A library is thousands of games. Textures are evicted
// least-recently-used once the budget is passed, and anything drawn this frame
// is never evicted.
//
// WHERE THE BYTES COME FROM IS NOT ITS BUSINESS. Today they are files on disk;
// in Phase 4 they are authenticated RomM requests. That is one std::function,
// so the cache never learns what a server is.
