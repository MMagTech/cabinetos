// Picture quality: Performance, Balanced or Quality, and what each emulator is
// told at each level. Issue #63, phase 1; the decisions and the measurements
// behind every value are in docs/PROJECT.md, "the automatic quality design"
// and the #63 decisions of 2026-10-02.
//
// ONE PLACE ANSWERS. Every emulator asks this file for its picture settings
// at launch and nothing else knows the levels exist. Settings are written
// fresh at every launch and nothing is synced, so the whole feature comes out
// in one ordinary update if it has to.
//
// THE DIAL MOVES TWO THINGS: the internal resolution, and on the emulators
// that offer it, whether shaders are built in the background (Balanced,
// Quality) or when first needed, with a short stutter (Performance).
// Everything else that is free is fixed at its best value for every level
// (anisotropic filtering 16x, 3DO's high resolution, sharp vector lines), and
// nothing here needs a file from anywhere.
//
// THE LEVEL FOR A GAME is the game's own choice if the player made one in its
// pause menu, otherwise the console's. A game's choice survives a change of
// the console's (MMagTech, 2026-10-02).
