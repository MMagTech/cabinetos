// Saves that are a DIRECTORY rather than a file.
//
// Every other platform's save is one blob: a cartridge battery, a memory card,
// a chunk of NVRAM. PSP's is a folder — `PSP/SAVEDATA/<GAMEID><TITLE>/` holding
// PARAM.SFO, DATA.BIN and the icons — because that is what a memory stick holds
// and what PPSSPP reads and writes on every platform it ships on. There is no
// single-file PSP save and no upstream format for one.
//
// RomM stores exactly one opaque file per game and emulator, so a folder has to
// travel as an archive. THE ARCHIVE IS ZIP, and the reasons are worth keeping:
//
//   * it is what the PSP world already uses to move save folders around, so a
//     file taken off the server can be opened by anyone with any unzip tool and
//     dropped straight into a memory stick;
//   * the frontend already links libarchive for ROMs, so it costs nothing here;
//   * the alternative was Apple's `rtfd`, which the reference implementation
//     used and which is readable nowhere without Foundation. That is being
//     changed on the Apple side too.
//
// THE CORE NEVER SEES THE ARCHIVE. It reads loose files out of the save
// directory exactly as it always has; the zip exists only between this console
// and RomM, and is unpacked before the core boots. Measured rather than assumed:
// zipping the real save folder, deleting it, and unpacking it back returns all
// four files byte-identical, and the game runs against the result.
//
// WHERE THE ZIP IS ROOTED, because this is the detail that silently breaks the
// other end: entries are relative to the SAVEDATA directory, so the first
// component is the save folder itself — `ULUS10002LUMINES/PARAM.SFO`. Opening
// one shows the game's save folder, which is what a person expects and what
// every PSP save download on the internet looks like. Unpack it into
// `<save dir>/PSP/SAVEDATA/`.
