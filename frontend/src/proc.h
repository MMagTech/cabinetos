// Running another program, without a shell anywhere in it.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. Two things in this console shell out — the
// NetworkManager plumbing and the Bluetooth plumbing — and both of them feed
// strings CHOSEN BY STRANGERS into the command they run. A Wi-Fi scan returns
// SSIDs that anybody within radio range picked; a Bluetooth scan returns device
// names that anybody within radio range picked. Somebody who names their
// network `"; rm -rf ~"` should be a row in a list and nothing else.
//
// So there is exactly ONE place in this program that starts a process, it takes
// an argv array, and it never builds a command line. Duplicating that into two
// files would be duplicating the part that must not be got wrong twice.
//
// IT BLOCKS, AND IT SAYS SO IN ITS NAME'S PLACE — here, because there is
// nowhere else to say it. A Wi-Fi scan takes seconds and a Bluetooth scan takes
// tens of them. Callers run this on a worker, exactly as romm::Client is run,
// and a frame loop that calls it has stopped drawing.
