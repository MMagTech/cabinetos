// Saves the CORE writes as a file, rather than ones this console can read out
// of the core's memory.
//
// WHAT WAS BROKEN, IN ONE SENTENCE: more than half the saves on a real RomM
// server belong to platforms this console could neither upload nor restore, so
// somebody who had been playing Dreamcast, arcade, 3DO, Sega CD, DS or Neo Geo
// Pocket on another device arrived here to an empty memory card and left
// without their progress reaching the server. Measured, not estimated — 47 of
// the 81 saves on the reference server, 58%, and the largest single block of
// them is Dreamcast's thirteen.
//
// It looked like an edge case because of how the fault presents. A core in
// this class answers `RETRO_MEMORY_SAVE_RAM` with nothing, so the console
// printed `[save] battery is 0 bytes` and did nothing further — which is a
// true statement about the core and says nothing at all about whether the game
// has a save. The save was on the disk the whole time, in a file the core
// opened for itself, and nobody was looking at it.
//
// THE MECHANISM IS THE ONE PSP ALREADY USES, and for the same two reasons that
// building PSP taught:
//
//   * RESTORE BEFORE THE CORE LOADS THE GAME. These cores read their save file
//     once, synchronously, while the machine is being built — Flycast while
//     `retro_load_game` sets up the Maple bus, Genesis Plus GX in `bram_load`,
//     Opera in `opera_lr_nvram_load`. A file that arrives afterwards is a file
//     the game has already decided is not there.
//   * CAPTURE AFTER `retro_unload_game`. A core buffers its writes and flushes
//     at shutdown; Flycast goes further and only closes the VMU in its
//     device's destructor at teardown, so the image on disk mid-session is
//     partial by construction. The reference implementation uploaded exactly
//     such a half-written card once and the game then reported it corrupt.
//
// AND THE THIRD RULE, WHICH IS THIS FILE'S OWN: compare against a baseline
// taken at launch. What changed between the restore and the quit is what this
// game saved, and everything else is a no-op. That is what keeps a console
// from filing a row on the server every time somebody looks at a title screen.
//
// catalog.h owns the TABLE — which platform writes what, where, and how to
// tell a real save from a formatted-empty one. This owns the mechanism.
