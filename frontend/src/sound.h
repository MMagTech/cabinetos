// The console's own voice: the short sounds the interface makes when somebody
// moves around it.
//
// MMagTech, 2026-09-21: *"i also think a navigation sound of some sort would be
// nice and later we have the option in settings to turn it off."* Both halves
// are built here: the sounds, and the switch. The switch is Settings' Interface
// sounds row, Off, Quiet, Medium or Loud (`setLevel`), and it is remembered.
//
// THE SOUNDS ARE SYNTHESISED, NOT RECORDED, and that is a deliberate choice
// with three reasons behind it:
//
//   NOTHING TO SHIP AND NOTHING TO LICENCE. This project keeps docs/LICENCES.md
//   because it cares where its parts came from. A recorded UI click is somebody
//   else's work with somebody else's terms attached, and four short sounds are
//   not worth a new class of obligation in the image.
//
//   THEY BECOME NUMBERS, like everything else in the design system. A click
//   that is "880 Hz, 45 ms, exponential decay" can be argued with in the same
//   way a focus scale can. A .wav can only be replaced.
//
//   THEY COST NOTHING. Each cue is a few thousand samples, built once at
//   startup and pushed at the device when it is asked for. No files, no
//   decoder, no disk.
//
// A UI SOUND IS NOT THE GAME'S SOUND. This opens its OWN stream on the default
// device rather than sharing the core's: the core's stream runs at whatever
// sample rate the emulated machine wants, it is opened and closed with the
// game, and the pause menu has to be able to click while a game is running.
// Two streams on one device is what SDL3's audio model is for.
