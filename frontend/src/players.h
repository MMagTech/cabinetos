// Which controller is which player (issue #64).
//
// UNTIL THIS EXISTED, ONE PAD PLAYED. Every pad could walk the menus, but a
// game read only the first pad SDL listed, as player one, and a second person
// holding a second pad pressed buttons that went nowhere.
//
// THE RULES, decided with MMagTech 2026-09-26 (docs/SETTINGS.md, Controllers):
//
// - Each pad that connects takes the next player, up to four. A system with
//   fewer ports uses the first ones.
// - OUTSIDE A GAME THE NUMBERS CLOSE UP: the pads that are on are 1, 2, 3 in
//   the order they connected, with no gaps. Two people finish, both pads go
//   to sleep, and whichever one is picked up next is player one.
// - DURING A GAME a pad that goes off keeps its number while any other pad is
//   still on, so player one's pad dying mid-race does not hand player two the
//   first car. It gets its number back when it returns.
// - DURING A GAME, IF EVERY PAD GOES OFF, the first one back is player one.
//   The two people put the pads down and picked up the wrong ones.
// - A person can give a pad a number in Settings; the two pads swap. Closing
//   up keeps the order, so the swap holds while both stay on.
//
// Every pad still drives the menus. This decides only who a game hears.
//
// THE RULES ARE A CLASS WITH NO SDL IN IT, `Seats`, so `--players-test` can
// walk every case headless. The functions below it are the SDL side.
