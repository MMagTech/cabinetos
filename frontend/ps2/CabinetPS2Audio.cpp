// The sound PCSX2 makes, handed to CabinetOS instead of to a sound card.
//
// **WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL.** PCSX2 has two perfectly good audio backends
// on Linux, cubeb and SDL, and either would make a PlayStation 2 game audible
// in about one line. Neither may be used here. The console owns audio for all
// twenty-one libretro cores — one device, one volume, one latency, and an
// in-game overlay that can duck it — and a second device open on the same
// hardware is none of those things. It is also the exact shape of fault this
// project already fixed for input: a second path onto hardware the frontend
// thought it owned.
//
// So PCSX2's SPU2 is given a stream that goes nowhere, and the frontend pulls
// out of it whenever its own mixer wants more. `AudioStream` is built for
// this: it buffers, it stretches when the emulator runs slow, and `ReadFrames`
// is the pull. Nothing here re-implements any of that.
//
// THE ONE PATCH THIS PROJECT MAKES TO PCSX2 IS WHAT ROUTES SPU2 HERE, and it
// is three lines in `AudioStream::CreateStream`. See cores/build-pcsx2.sh.
// Cabinet makes the same edit on the Mac for the same reason.
