// The flat C face CabinetOS's frontend opens with dlopen.
//
// **WHY A SHARED OBJECT RATHER THAN LINKING PCSX2 INTO THE FRONTEND.** Two
// reasons, and either alone would decide it.
//
// The licence is the hard one. PCSX2 is GPLv3 and this repository is MIT.
// docs/LICENCES.md rests its whole position on one sentence — "the cores are
// `dlopen`ed rather than statically linked" — which is what keeps the frontend
// binary its own work rather than part of a combined GPLv3 one. Every libretro
// core already arrives this way; PlayStation 2 arrives the same way, and the
// argument does not have to be reopened.
//
// The practical one is the build. PCSX2 needs about thirty development
// packages the frontend's own builder image does not have and should not grow;
// its Containerfile is small on purpose, because it also builds twenty-one
// cores. Keeping the emulator behind a `.so` means the frontend's Makefile does
// not change at all.
//
// So this is deliberately a C API and deliberately dull: no C++ types cross it,
// nothing is thrown, and every function is safe to call when nothing is
// running. That is the same contract the libretro cores meet, and it is what
// lets frontend/src/core.cpp treat PlayStation 2 as one more thing it loads.
