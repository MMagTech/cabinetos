# a static link puts the emulator inside the frontend's own binary, which makes

# distributed and never enters the image. The shipping path is the one open
# question 12's correction already chose for a different reason: each emulator
# becomes its own .so behind a struct of function pointers, exactly like the
# twenty-one libretro cores, which keeps the same arms-length arrangement
# LICENCES.md already relies on. Do not "simplify" this into the frontend link.
#
# Order matters for static archives, and --start-group is how you avoid having

# --- the shared object the console actually loads --------------------------
#
# THIS IS WHAT SHIPS. The probe above is a development tool; this is the file
# the frontend dlopens, and it exists rather than a static link for two
# reasons, either of which would decide it on its own.
#
# The licence is the hard one: PCSX2 is GPLv3 and this repository is MIT, and
# docs/LICENCES.md rests its position on the emulators being dlopen'ed rather
# than linked in. The practical one is that the frontend's builder image does
# not carry PCSX2's thirty-odd dependencies and should not grow them.
#
# -z defs so the linker REFUSES a .so with anything unresolved. Without it a
# missing symbol becomes a dlopen failure on the console at the moment somebody
# starts a game, naming one symbol and telling you nothing about the rest.
# -rpath $ORIGIN so the emulator can carry libraries the console does not have,
# and --disable-new-dtags because THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RPATH AND RUNPATH
# DECIDES WHETHER THIS WORKS AT ALL.
#
# The modern default is RUNPATH, and RUNPATH is NOT INHERITED: it is consulted
# for this object's own direct dependencies and ignored when one of THOSE goes
# looking for something. Measured here — libryml was found and then could not
# find libc4core, which sat in the same directory. RPATH, the older tag, does
# apply down the chain, which is exactly what a bundle of transitive libraries
# needs. The flag asks for the old tag.
#
# MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, on the reference console 2026-09-21: of
# everything this links, the image is missing exactly ONE — libryml, rapidyaml,
# which PCSX2 uses to read its game database. Everything else PCSX2 wants is
# already there for the frontend and the twenty-one cores: shaderc, plutovg,
# plutosvg, harfbuzz, pcap, SPIRV-Tools.
#
# So the emulator ships that one library beside itself rather than the image
# growing a package for it. That keeps a base bump from being able to take
# PlayStation 2 away quietly — which is a real risk this project has written up
# for the OTHER libraries in ci/base-watch.txt, where those do belong.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2086,SC2016  # SYS is word-split on purpose, and $ORIGIN
# is a LINKER token that must reach ld unexpanded — the shell must not touch it.
